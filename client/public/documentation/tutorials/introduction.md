### KingKong Platform Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the KingKong platform. This guide will help you understand the core concepts, get started with the Figma plugin, and master the AI-powered Query API to build dynamic, data-driven applications.

### 1\. Introduction

KingKong is a powerful platform that bridges the gap between design and development by providing a conversational AI backend for your applications. Instead of building a custom backend and writing complex APIs, KingKong allows you to manage and query your data using natural language.

The platform consists of two main components:

    - The KingKong Web App: Your personal data hub where you can sign up, create projects, manage data models (e.g., users, products, posts), and get your unique API key.
    - The KingKong Figma Plugin: A powerful interface that integrates the KingKong AI directly into your Figma design workflow. It allows designers to create interactive prototypes that are powered by real data, all without writing a single line of code.

Key Benefits:

    - Accelerated Prototyping: Turn static designs into dynamic, data-rich prototypes in minutes.
    - Conversational Backend: Use simple prompts like "Get the latest 10 blog posts" to perform complex database queries.
    - Seamless Integration: KingKong's variables and events bind directly to your Figma designs, making your prototypes feel like a real application.
    - No-Code Development: Eliminate the need for a separate backend team for simple projects and prototypes.
