## 2. Getting Started

To begin using KingKong, you'll need to set up a project and get your API key.

### Step 1: Sign Up and Create a Project

	1. Go to the KingKong Web App: Navigate to `https://app.kingkong.io` (Note: This is an example URL and should be replaced with the actual URL).

	2. **Sign Up:** Create a new account.

	3. **Create a Project:** In your dashboard, click "New Project." Give your project a name that corresponds to your application or design (e.g., "E-commerce Store," "User Dashboard"). Each project is a dedicated container for your app's data.

	4. **Get Your API Key:** Once your project is created, navigate to its settings. You will find your unique Project API Key. Copy this key—you will need it for the Figma plugin.

### Step 2: Install and Authenticate the Figma Plugin

	1. **Install the Plugin:** In Figma, go to "Community" and search for "KingKong." Click "Install."

	2. **Launch the Plugin:** Go to your Figma design file, right-click on the canvas, navigate to "Plugins" and select "KingKong."

	3. **Authenticate:** The first time you launch the plugin, it will prompt you for your API key. Paste the key you copied in Step 1 and click "Connect." Your Figma plugin is now securely connected to your KingKong project.

### Step 3: Importing or Creating Data Models

	Your KingKong project needs data to work. You can either import existing data or use the KingKong playground to create it.

	1. In the KingKong Web App, navigate to your project.

	2. **Create Models:** You can define a new data model (e.g., Users, Products) and their properties (e.g., name, email, price).

	3. **Import Data:** You can also import data from a JSON file to quickly populate your database.
